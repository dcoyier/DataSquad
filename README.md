Since September 2025, I have worked on the Carleton College DataSquad as a Technical Writer. Information about the DataSquad can be found here: https://www.carleton.edu/its/services/learning/datasquad/.

Most of my time has been spent on co-authoring a journal article (https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19688) that assesses the DataSquad model. One of my main roles with this paper was to help create visuals in R.

Additionally, I have spent time updating the DataSquad website (https://carletondatasquad.bitbucket.io/) and writing blog posts (https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/automating-technology-check-scheduling/ and https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/reconnecting-with-datasquad-alumni/).

Files: 
- DS-assessment.qmd is a Quarto file made summarize results from the 2025 DataSquad assessment project.
- DS-assessment-quarto.html is the html output for this Quarto file (see https://carletondatasquad.bitbucket.io/quarto-assessment.html)
- The remaining R files and png's are from the journal article, and they were used in the Quarto webpage as well
