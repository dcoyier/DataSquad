Since September 2025, I have worked on the Carleton College DataSquad as a Technical Writer. Information about the DataSquad can be found here: https://www.carleton.edu/its/services/learning/datasquad/.

Most of my time has been spent on co-authoring a journal article (https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19688) that assesses the DataSquad model. One of my main roles with this paper was to assist with the creation of visuals.

Additionally, I have spent time updating the DataSquad website (https://carletondatasquad.bitbucket.io/) and writing blog posts (https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/automating-technology-check-scheduling/ and https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/reconnecting-with-datasquad-alumni/).
